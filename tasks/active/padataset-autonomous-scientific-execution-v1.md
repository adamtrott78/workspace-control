# Workspace Control Task Handoff

Derived human-readable view.

Authoritative capsule: tasks/active/padataset-autonomous-scientific-execution-v1.json

If this view disagrees with the JSON capsule or verified Git/runtime evidence, trust the capsule plus verified evidence.

## Task

- ID: padataset-autonomous-scientific-execution-v1
- Title: PADataset autonomous scientific execution v1
- Status: IN_PROGRESS
- Capsule schema: v2
- Current stage: scientific_activation_validation

## Goal

Make PADataset scientific GPU experiments autonomously executable by ChatGPT through the existing self-hosted Lambda control plane using an exact root-owned DNNs runtime, exact PR-head provenance, read-only project data/cache authority, bounded experiment request schemas, durable artifacts/receipts, and no per-run operator terminal work.

## Next safe action

On the Lambda host, perform a read-only filesystem-capacity/inode/large-directory diagnostic and inspect the v0.4.8 worktree index.lock. Do not delete files yet. After reclaiming space with a separately justified cleanup, rerun heartbeat-up; then perform one fresh authenticated GitHub rate-limit probe and restart the exact v3 control-small controller only if remaining quota is positive. Do not cancel or duplicate validation #466.

## Remaining work

- Contain the v3 control-small controller restart storm and recover after the GitHub REST primary-rate-limit window resets; preserve validation #466 without duplicate requests.
- Once #466 runs, require SUCCESS or diagnose its exact failure. Then recheck main and integrate current main into the activation branch with unchanged scientific tree, followed by exact-head validation of the integrated SHA.
- Advance the validated integrated policy to main so Lambda CI Project Reconcile installs the exact runtime/data/contract/route policy.
- Verify live reconciliation and run autonomous scientific smoke, bounded training smoke, full PA2 Stage03 backbone training, and Architecture C evaluation.
- Track the v3 controller 403 rate-limit handling defect for a separately authorized infrastructure hotfix; current code retries 429/5xx but treats primary-rate-limit 403 as fatal.

## Blockers / gates

- Dedicated exact-head Lambda CI Workspace Control Validation #466 / run 43149651861 / job 130955554208 remains queued without runner assignment.
- workspace-ci-v3-controller@workspace-control-control-small-v1.service is intentionally stopped/inactive at NRestarts=3495 after a GitHub primary-rate-limit 403 restart storm. Authenticated probe previously showed 0/5000 core remaining with reset epoch 1794488297; a fresh post-reset probe is still required before restart.
- Workspace Heartbeat local v0.4.8 runtime provenance and direct Node startup are healthy, but host filesystem exhaustion is now proven by Git reporting index.lock write error: Out of diskspace. heartbeat-up fails before tunnel startup, likely because its conda/npm launcher path requires filesystem writes.
- Scientific route must not be reconciled or invoked until exact-head validation and live reconciliation succeed.

## Fresh-chat initialization

@GitHub

https://github.com/adamtrott78/workspace-control

Continue the durable workspace-control task defined by:
Task capsule: tasks/active/padataset-autonomous-scientific-execution-v1.json

Start from the normal workspace-control root route.
Treat the task capsule, exact durable Git/runtime state, and referenced owning context/evidence as the handoff.
Do not rely on previous conversation state.
Follow the capsule's next_safe_action.
