# Workspace Control Task Handoff

Derived human-readable view.

Authoritative capsule: tasks/active/padataset-autonomous-scientific-execution-v1.json

If this view disagrees with the JSON capsule or verified Git/runtime evidence, trust the capsule plus verified evidence.

## Task

- ID: padataset-autonomous-scientific-execution-v1
- Title: PADataset autonomous scientific execution v1
- Status: IN_PROGRESS
- Capsule schema: v2

## Goal

Make PADataset scientific GPU experiments autonomously executable by ChatGPT through the existing self-hosted Lambda control plane using an exact root-owned DNNs runtime, exact PR-head provenance, read-only project data/cache authority, bounded experiment request schemas, durable artifacts/receipts, and no per-run operator terminal work.

## Next safe action

Operator read-only diagnosis of workspace-control-control-small-v1 only: inspect workspace-ci-v3-controller@workspace-control-control-small-v1.service state and journal since 2026-11-12 16:55:30 EST; inspect its controller ledger, provisioner records for runner_class_id workspace-control-control-small-v1, and active target-class transients. Correlate specifically with GitHub run 43315043736/job 131520720719. Do not restart or mutate. Use the evidence to determine whether the control controller is inactive/crashing, has admitted the job but failed root provisioning, or is not receiving scheduler demand.

## Remaining work

- Run the first live non-destructive scientific smoke through /lambda-scientific. It must verify exact workflow/runtime/data bindings, import torch, see exactly one authorized GPU, load the frozen Stage03 config, write only a tiny bounded artifact, and perform no training.
- After the non-destructive smoke passes and cleans up, run one bounded 1-epoch training smoke from an exact candidate PR with full cleanup/runtime-integrity receipts.
- Then execute the full frozen PA2 Stage03 backbone training, followed by Architecture C evaluation, preserving exact candidate/workflow/runtime/data provenance and bounded artifacts.
- Complete final cleanup/residue/runtime-integrity verification and durable task closure.
- Refresh Workspace Shell trusted task authority to include padataset-autonomous-scientific-execution-v1 only after the final promoted/activated scientific state and first live proofs are durable.
- Track the separate v3 controller primary-rate-limit 403 handling defect under separately authorized infrastructure scope; do not mix that hotfix into this scientific task.

## Blockers / gates

- Authoritative Validation #484 cannot currently acquire the workspace-control control-validation self-hosted lane. Read-only Lambda host evidence is now required; connected Workspace Shell authority for this PADataset task cannot inspect that lane without widening trust.
- Do not reissue /workspace-control-validate, merge PR #622, restart services, edit controller ledgers, or retrigger the scientific smoke before diagnosing the existing queued control-validation job 131520720719.

## Fresh-chat initialization

@GitHub

https://github.com/adamtrott78/workspace-control

Continue the durable workspace-control task defined by:
Task capsule: tasks/active/padataset-autonomous-scientific-execution-v1.json

Start from the normal workspace-control root route.
Treat the task capsule, exact durable Git/runtime state, and referenced owning context/evidence as the handoff.
Do not rely on previous conversation state.
Follow the capsule's next_safe_action.
