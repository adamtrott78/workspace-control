# Workspace Control Task Handoff

Derived human-readable view.

Authoritative capsule: tasks/active/workspace-lambda-multirepo-research-execution-v1.json

If this view disagrees with the JSON capsule or verified Git/runtime evidence, trust the capsule plus verified evidence.

## Task

- ID: workspace-lambda-multirepo-research-execution-v1
- Title: Workspace Lambda Multi-Repository Research Execution v1
- Status: IN_PROGRESS
- Capsule schema: v2

## Goal

Generalize the accepted GitHub-to-Lambda execution substrate from a research-engine-specific pilot into a reusable, fail-closed, manifest-driven research compute control plane that can execute bounded candidate code from research-engine, PADataset, and future explicitly authorized research repositories without per-task controller/provisioner/runtime patches or routine human SSH/sudo intervention.

### PADataset

- Remote verified: true

## Next safe action

VALIDATE SOURCE REPAIR FIRST. Open/validate the fix-reconcile-socket-parent-run3 changes: shared /run/workspace-ci parent root:root 0711 with per-socket 0660 groups, durable service-side parent normalization, migration assertions, non-mutating SUDO_USER Git preflights, exact socket-hotfix manifest/helper, and focused tests. Require the repository's selected validation tier to PASS before any live host repair. Do not rerun the old hotfix helper, change policy, bump registry_epoch, rerun the full migration, restage the token, or onboard PADataset.

## Remaining work

- Run 3 immediate: validate and merge the socket-parent/operator-Git repair, then from an exact clean detached worktree apply only the validated reconciliation socket hotfix. Before the helper, repair the one proven root-owned stale worktree index or use a fresh worktree; require socket parent/group isolation PASS and terminal RUN3_RECONCILIATION_PLANE=PASS.
- Run 3: checkpoint the accepted Git-driven reconciliation controller/root path; only then mark git_driven_project_reconciliation VALIDATED.
- Run 3: run research-engine CPU, gpu-small and at least one already-accepted model-eval regression through the generic installed path, with clean terminal receipts and zero residue/quarantine.
- Run 4: bind PADataset CPU/GPU launcher workflow blobs, onboard PADataset by registry/manifest reconciliation only, then execute non-scientific CPU/GPU canaries.
- Run 4: prove reciprocal research-engine/PADataset filesystem/process/cache isolation and verify zero controller/provisioner/runtime source changes during PADataset onboarding.
- Final: prove a third approved repository requires only registry + manifest + thin launcher binding and freeze the reusable operating contract.

## Blockers / gates

- Source-level root cause is diagnosed and a bounded repair is staged on branch fix-reconcile-socket-parent-run3, but it is not yet validated or live. Do not mutate /run/workspace-ci, installed root services, or restart the reconciliation controller until the repair PR passes required repository validation.

## Fresh-chat initialization

@GitHub

https://github.com/adamtrott78/workspace-control

Continue the durable workspace-control task defined by:
Task capsule: tasks/active/workspace-lambda-multirepo-research-execution-v1.json

Start from the normal workspace-control root route.
Treat the task capsule, exact durable Git/runtime state, and referenced owning context/evidence as the handoff.
Do not rely on previous conversation state.
Follow the capsule's next_safe_action.
