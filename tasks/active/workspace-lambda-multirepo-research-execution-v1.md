# Workspace Control Task Handoff

Derived human-readable view.

Authoritative capsule: tasks/active/workspace-lambda-multirepo-research-execution-v1.json

If this view disagrees with the JSON capsule or verified Git/runtime evidence, trust the capsule plus verified evidence.

## Task

- ID: workspace-lambda-multirepo-research-execution-v1
- Title: Workspace Lambda Multi-Repository Research Execution v1
- Status: IN_PROGRESS
- Capsule schema: v2

## Goal

Generalize the accepted GitHub-to-Lambda execution substrate from a research-engine-specific pilot into a reusable, fail-closed, manifest-driven research compute control plane that can execute bounded candidate code from research-engine, PADataset, and future explicitly authorized research repositories without per-task controller/provisioner/runtime patches or routine human SSH/sudo intervention.

## Next safe action

RUN 4 CPU ROOT CLEANUP GATE: inspect the most recent padataset provisioner record for candidate abb797dc480bdb8764b0f377d4f4d5b8fce13f3f and workload cpu-ci; require COMPLETED, RUNNER_EXITED_CLEANLY/SUCCEEDED, runner/staging workspaces destroyed, project UID cleanup true, no timeout/resource/disk pressure, and matching root runtime receipt. Also require no remaining padataset p5-* job/staging directories, no ci-padataset process residue, no padataset lane quarantine, and stable padataset CPU/GPU controllers. Only after PASS trigger gpu-ci on the same immutable PR #2 head.

## Remaining work

- Run 4: bind PADataset CPU/GPU launcher workflow blobs, onboard PADataset by registry/manifest reconciliation only, then execute non-scientific CPU/GPU canaries.
- Run 4: prove reciprocal research-engine/PADataset filesystem/process/cache isolation and verify zero controller/provisioner/runtime source changes during PADataset onboarding.
- Final: prove a third approved repository requires only registry + manifest + thin launcher binding and freeze the reusable operating contract.

## Blockers / gates

- PADataset credential scope and CPU workflow are accepted. GPU canary is gated only on read-only root cleanup acceptance for CPU request/workload cpu-ci at exact candidate abb797dc480bdb8764b0f377d4f4d5b8fce13f3f.

## Fresh-chat initialization

@GitHub

https://github.com/adamtrott78/workspace-control

Continue the durable workspace-control task defined by:
Task capsule: tasks/active/workspace-lambda-multirepo-research-execution-v1.json

Start from the normal workspace-control root route.
Treat the task capsule, exact durable Git/runtime state, and referenced owning context/evidence as the handoff.
Do not rely on previous conversation state.
Follow the capsule's next_safe_action.
