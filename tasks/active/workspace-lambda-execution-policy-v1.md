# Workspace Control Task Handoff

Derived human-readable view.

Authoritative capsule: tasks/active/workspace-lambda-execution-policy-v1.json

If this view disagrees with the JSON capsule or verified Git/runtime evidence, trust the capsule plus verified evidence.

## Task

- ID: workspace-lambda-execution-policy-v1
- Title: Workspace Lambda Execution Policy and Model Workload Governance v1
- Status: IN_PROGRESS
- Capsule schema: v2

## Goal

Design, implement, and adversarially validate a fail-closed workload admission, trusted model/dependency cache, resource-governance, and execution-evidence layer on top of the accepted Lambda P5 CPU and gpu-small autonomous runner substrate so ChatGPT/GitHub-driven work can safely execute pinned model-scale workloads without granting candidate workflow code the ability to invent capabilities, persist mutable cross-job state, access production/scientific state, or widen host authority.

## Next safe action

Integrate the accepted immutable expanded runtime path into the existing gpu-small provisioner/execution surface without enabling any new workload class or widening privileges. The provisioner must bind the exact expanded-runtime receipt/tree digest b0cbb4efbe8673bdb421bad8036d29864bffe0687a9a654bbd95f54544659e63 and canonical runtime path, mount it read-only (ro,nosuid,nodev) inside the job's private mount namespace, redirect all writable Python/Torch/vLLM/HF/tmp/cache state to the disposable job workspace, and refuse execution if the runtime receipt/tree identity or mount flags differ. Then run the adversarial/recovery acceptance matrix against that final path: candidate mutation/chmod/truncate/rename attempts, stale/corrupt receipt or tree rejection, replay/stale admission, interruption/timeout, cleanup failure, disk pressure, GPU/process residue, and concurrency/isolation. Keep model inference disabled during this phase; the first bounded real Qwen gpu-small canary remains a later separate stage.

## Remaining work

- Run adversarial recovery, replay, cleanup, resource-exhaustion, cache-integrity, and concurrency acceptance.
- Run the first offline Qwen3.5-4B pinned-model pilot on gpu-small.
- Decide separately whether gpu-heavy/dual-GPU should be accepted.

## Blockers / gates

- None.

Continue the durable workspace-control task defined by:
Task capsule: tasks/active/workspace-lambda-execution-policy-v1.json

Start from the normal workspace-control root route.
Treat the task capsule, exact durable Git/runtime state, and referenced owning context/evidence as the handoff.
Do not rely on previous conversation state.
Follow the capsule's next_safe_action.
