# Workspace Control Task Handoff

Derived human-readable view.

Authoritative capsule: tasks/active/workspace-lambda-execution-policy-v1.json

If this view disagrees with the JSON capsule or verified Git/runtime evidence, trust the capsule plus verified evidence.

## Task

- ID: workspace-lambda-execution-policy-v1
- Title: Workspace Lambda Execution Policy and Model Workload Governance v1
- Status: IN_PROGRESS
- Capsule schema: v2

## Goal

Design, implement, and adversarially validate a fail-closed workload admission, trusted model/dependency cache, resource-governance, and execution-evidence layer on top of the accepted Lambda P5 CPU and gpu-small autonomous runner substrate so ChatGPT/GitHub-driven work can safely execute pinned model-scale workloads without granting candidate workflow code the ability to invent capabilities, persist mutable cross-job state, access production/scientific state, or widen host authority.

## Repositories

### workspace-control

- Intent: mutate
- Remote branch: main
- Remote checkpoint: 15a4feadadefc9bdaf710e6c624805d1370881f1
- Remote verified: true

### research-engine

- Intent: mutate
- Remote branch: main

- Remote verified: true

## Next safe action

Continue adversarial_recovery_and_resource_validation without reopening the accepted immutable-runtime architecture. Next, validate recovery/replay semantics on the existing admitted execution substrate: (1) prove controller restart/recovery does not duplicate or re-execute a consumed request; (2) prove identical terminal request replay returns existing terminal state/receipt rather than launching a runner; (3) prove stale/expired admission is rejected. Reuse existing durable request/receipt state where possible and do not create a new GPU execution solely for replay measurement. After those pass, proceed to deliberate cleanup-failure/timeout/resource-pressure/cache-integrity/concurrency cases. Keep model weights and inference disabled.

## Remaining work

- Run adversarial recovery, replay, cleanup, resource-exhaustion, cache-integrity, and concurrency acceptance.
- Run the first offline Qwen3.5-4B pinned-model pilot on gpu-small.
- Decide separately whether gpu-heavy/dual-GPU should be accepted.

## Blockers / gates

- None.

Continue the durable workspace-control task defined by:
Task capsule: tasks/active/workspace-lambda-execution-policy-v1.json

Start from the normal workspace-control root route.
Treat the task capsule, exact durable Git/runtime state, and referenced owning context/evidence as the handoff.
Do not rely on previous conversation state.
Follow the capsule's next_safe_action.
