# Workspace Control Task Handoff

Derived human-readable view.

Authoritative capsule: tasks/active/workspace-lambda-execution-policy-v1.json

If this view disagrees with the JSON capsule or verified Git/runtime evidence, trust the capsule plus verified evidence.

## Task

- ID: workspace-lambda-execution-policy-v1
- Title: Workspace Lambda Execution Policy and Model Workload Governance v1
- Status: IN_PROGRESS
- Capsule schema: v2

## Goal

Design, implement, and adversarially validate a fail-closed workload admission, trusted model/dependency cache, resource-governance, and execution-evidence layer on top of the accepted Lambda P5 CPU and gpu-small autonomous runner substrate so ChatGPT/GitHub-driven work can safely execute pinned model-scale workloads without granting candidate workflow code the ability to invent capabilities, persist mutable cross-job state, access production/scientific state, or widen host authority.

## Next safe action

Start trusted_cache_promotion_and_provenance from the existing workspace-control trusted-cache policy and research-engine residual-model-prefetch/runtime-certification contracts. First hydrate the canonical cache/promotion designs and exact Qwen3.5-4B model/runtime identities, then implement the minimum root/trusted-authority acquisition-quarantine-promotion path plus read-only content-addressed cache verification needed for a non-scientific offline model-eval pilot. Do not enable model-acquire, cache-promote, or model-eval-single-gpu live routes until their implementation and adversarial cache-integrity/offline-completeness gates are validated. Keep gpu-heavy denied and do not mutate research-engine production/scientific state.

## Remaining work

- Implement trusted acquisition/quarantine/promotion and read-only content-addressed model/runtime cache semantics.
- Run adversarial recovery, replay, cleanup, resource-exhaustion, cache-integrity, and concurrency acceptance.
- Run the first offline Qwen3.5-4B pinned-model pilot on gpu-small.
- Decide separately whether gpu-heavy/dual-GPU should be accepted.

## Blockers / gates

- None.

Continue the durable workspace-control task defined by:
Task capsule: tasks/active/workspace-lambda-execution-policy-v1.json

Start from the normal workspace-control root route.
Treat the task capsule, exact durable Git/runtime state, and referenced owning context/evidence as the handoff.
Do not rely on previous conversation state.
Follow the capsule's next_safe_action.
