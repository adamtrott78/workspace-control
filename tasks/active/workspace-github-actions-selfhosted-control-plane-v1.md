# Workspace Control Task Handoff

Derived human-readable view.

Authoritative capsule: tasks/active/workspace-github-actions-selfhosted-control-plane-v1.json

If this view disagrees with the JSON capsule or verified Git/runtime evidence, trust the capsule plus verified evidence.

## Task

- ID: workspace-github-actions-selfhosted-control-plane-v1
- Title: GitHub Actions Self-Hosted Control Plane v1
- Status: IN_PROGRESS
- Capsule schema: v2

## Goal

Eliminate routine dependence on metered GitHub-hosted runners by moving workspace-control and project CI onto bounded self-hosted Lambda execution while preserving a non-circular bootstrap authority, per-project isolation, fail-closed admission, review gates, and a clean path to GitHub organization runner groups. Also reduce operator copy/paste by making review targets and dispositions durable and GitHub-native.

## Repositories

### workspace-control

- Intent: mutate
- Remote branch: main

- Remote verified: true

### research-engine

## Next safe action

No further V3 controller repair is required. Reconciled workspace-control execution head 6466ff118127af1dfcc2dbf6aa69833fe1d06c04 passed run #438, and state-only authority 3fb385039108074bef7b5d142bb4fc4781a5c9ab passed run #441. Hand off to workspace-shell-multirepo-research-v1 for live runtime refresh; keep PR #604 unmerged and retired V2 untouched.

## Remaining work

- Hand control back to workspace-shell-multirepo-research-v1 for the already-designed live Workspace Shell/PADataset runtime refresh.

## Blockers / gates

- None.

## Fresh-chat initialization

Continue the durable workspace-control task defined by:
Task capsule: tasks/active/workspace-github-actions-selfhosted-control-plane-v1.json

Start from the normal workspace-control root route.
Treat the task capsule, exact durable Git/runtime state, and referenced owning context/evidence as the handoff.
Do not rely on previous conversation state.
Follow the capsule's next_safe_action.
