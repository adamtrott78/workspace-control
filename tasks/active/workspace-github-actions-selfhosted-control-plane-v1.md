# Workspace Control Task Handoff

Derived human-readable view.

Authoritative capsule: tasks/active/workspace-github-actions-selfhosted-control-plane-v1.json

If this view disagrees with the JSON capsule or verified Git/runtime evidence, trust the capsule plus verified evidence.

## Task

- ID: workspace-github-actions-selfhosted-control-plane-v1
- Title: GitHub Actions Self-Hosted Control Plane v1
- Status: IN_PROGRESS
- Capsule schema: v2

## Goal

Eliminate routine dependence on metered GitHub-hosted runners by moving workspace-control and project CI onto bounded self-hosted Lambda execution while preserving a non-circular bootstrap authority, per-project isolation, fail-closed admission, review gates, and a clean path to GitHub organization runner groups. Also reduce operator copy/paste by making review targets and dispositions durable and GitHub-native.

## Repositories

- Remote verified: true

## Next safe action

On the Lambda host, from an exact clean workspace-control checkout at merged main, run only the bounded read-only P1 host preflight. Capture service states/restart counts, active workspace-ci units/processes, installed controller/provisioner/reconciler/runtime hashes, installed registry/project manifests, controller template effective unit, controller/reconciler/maintenance identity and token-file ownership/modes without reading token contents, socket ownership/modes, project-root metadata, controller envs, and isolated Go 1.26.3 availability. Do not stop/start/restart/enable/disable/copy/install/reconcile/activate or trigger any workflow. Return the exact preflight output to this task so a rollback-safe P1 installation plan can be derived before mutation.

## Remaining work

- Run the bounded read-only Lambda host preflight against merged workspace-control main 99972dd906bb16099645237d584d380beca88171; do not mutate host state during preflight.
- From that evidence, install only the exact reviewed P1 controller/provisioner/runtime/maintenance/systemd/policy artifacts while preserving current research-engine/PADataset service availability and an independently recoverable bootstrap/rollback path.
- Activate workspace-control only as the reviewed owner-commanded same-repository CPU pilot with maxRunners=1 and manifest concurrency=1; keep automatic pull_request/push admission disabled.
- Validate live P1 filesystem isolation, CPU/RAM/runtime envelope, GPU0, exact candidate provenance, deterministic receipts, maintenance authorization/replay behavior, and clean teardown/rollback.
- After live P1 acceptance, continue the separately gated work to remove routine GitHub-hosted Actions minutes; do not remove the last bootstrap path in the same change.
- Leave P2 automatic pull_request/push admission, P3 organization migration, GitHub App credential migration, resource-aware concurrency widening, and unrelated transport cleanup unauthorized.

## Blockers / gates

- No GitHub-side review blocker remains. Live P1 installation is gated only on a read-only Lambda host preflight proving the current installed service/file/identity/socket/credential metadata and preserving the independent bootstrap/rollback path before any root mutation.

## Fresh-chat initialization

@GitHub

https://github.com/adamtrott78/workspace-control

Continue the durable workspace-control task defined by:
Task capsule: tasks/active/workspace-github-actions-selfhosted-control-plane-v1.json

Start from the normal workspace-control root route.
Treat the task capsule, exact durable Git/runtime state, and referenced owning context/evidence as the handoff.
Do not rely on previous conversation state.
Follow the capsule's next_safe_action.
