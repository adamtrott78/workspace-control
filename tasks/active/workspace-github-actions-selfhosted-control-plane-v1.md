# Workspace Control Task Handoff

Derived human-readable view.

Authoritative capsule: tasks/active/workspace-github-actions-selfhosted-control-plane-v1.json

If this view disagrees with the JSON capsule or verified Git/runtime evidence, trust the capsule plus verified evidence.

## Task

- ID: workspace-github-actions-selfhosted-control-plane-v1
- Title: GitHub Actions Self-Hosted Control Plane v1
- Status: IN_PROGRESS
- Capsule schema: v2

## Goal

Eliminate routine dependence on metered GitHub-hosted runners by moving workspace-control and project CI onto bounded self-hosted Lambda execution while preserving a non-circular bootstrap authority, per-project isolation, fail-closed admission, review gates, and a clean path to GitHub organization runner groups. Also reduce operator copy/paste by making review targets and dispositions durable and GitHub-native.

## Next safe action

Fresh independent corrected-head P1 activation-boundary re-review of PR #558 only. Consume prior blocking reviews 6451020368 and 6451350758. Verify BF-3 closure specifically: rollback is armed before forward write #1; exceptions surfaced after replacement by write #1/#2/#3 all enter rollback; exact old root/controller bytes are restored; any newly installed one-shot unit is removed; root daemon reload/restart is bounded and non-propagating; automatic/workspace-control/sibling service snapshots are re-certified; rollback explicitly verifies restored bytes and absent unit before claiming success. Verify fault-injection regressions cover all three forward write boundaries after replacement. Regression-check BF-1 request-bound exact restart/enable/preserve semantics and BF-2 static sandbox-preserving one-shot unit/installer boundaries remain unchanged. Return NO_BLOCKING_FINDING or exact actionable blockers. Do not merge or mutate Lambda during review.

## Remaining work

- Obtain fresh independent exact-head review of PR #545, focused on source provenance, exact old installed digest binding, preservation of failed receipt/cursor, candidate dormancy, project-controller preservation, the single root-maintenance service restart mutation, bounded socket readiness, and rollback restoration.
- After accepted merge, run the reviewed installer exactly once from its exact merge SHA and inspect the complete hotfix receipt before any maintenance retry.
- Only after installer PASS, post exactly one new owner `/workspace-ci-maintain diagnose workspace-control cpu` command and prove a durable COMPLETED observation-only receipt; do not reuse failed comment 6437389584.
- Only after the diagnostic receipt is accepted may workspace-control activation be independently gated as the reviewed owner-commanded same-repository CPU pilot with maxRunners=1 and manifest concurrency=1.
- Validate live P1 filesystem isolation, CPU/RAM/runtime envelope, GPU0, exact candidate provenance, deterministic receipts, maintenance authorization/replay behavior, and clean teardown/rollback.
- Leave P2 automatic pull_request/push admission, P3 organization migration, GitHub App credential migration, resource-aware concurrency widening, and unrelated transport cleanup unauthorized.

## Blockers / gates

- PR #558 remains review-only and unmerged pending fresh independent corrected-head activation-boundary review of BF-3 closure.
- The corrected activation submission-boundary installer is validated in source but not installed on Lambda.
- Do not merge PR #558, install the submission boundary, reconcile/activate workspace-control, start the automatic reconcile-controller, issue maintenance commands, restart/reset preserved project controllers, restart research-engine CPU, or widen P2/P3/capacity before corrected-head review returns NO_BLOCKING_FINDING.

Continue the durable workspace-control task defined by:
Task capsule: tasks/active/workspace-github-actions-selfhosted-control-plane-v1.json

Start from the normal workspace-control root route.
Treat the task capsule, exact durable Git/runtime state, and referenced owning context/evidence as the handoff.
Do not rely on previous conversation state.
Follow the capsule's next_safe_action.
