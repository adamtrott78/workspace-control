# Workspace Control Task Handoff

Derived human-readable view.

Authoritative capsule: tasks/active/workspace-github-actions-selfhosted-control-plane-v1.json

If this view disagrees with the JSON capsule or verified Git/runtime evidence, trust the capsule plus verified evidence.

## Task

- ID: workspace-github-actions-selfhosted-control-plane-v1
- Title: GitHub Actions Self-Hosted Control Plane v1
- Status: IN_PROGRESS
- Capsule schema: v2

## Goal

Eliminate routine dependence on metered GitHub-hosted runners by moving workspace-control and project CI onto bounded self-hosted Lambda execution while preserving a non-circular bootstrap authority, per-project isolation, fail-closed admission, review gates, and a clean path to GitHub organization runner groups. Also reduce operator copy/paste by making review targets and dispositions durable and GitHub-native.

## Repositories

### workspace-control

- Remote verified: true

### research-engine

- Remote verified: true

## Next safe action

Run the already-reviewed reconciler hotfix installer from a clean detached checkout of exact merge e4c81ac5fba8c4d9df8450b003147f90d771158b, capture its complete receipt and exit status, then stop and review that evidence before any reconciliation or activation.

## Remaining work

- Obtain fresh independent exact-head review of PR #545, focused on source provenance, exact old installed digest binding, preservation of failed receipt/cursor, candidate dormancy, project-controller preservation, the single root-maintenance service restart mutation, bounded socket readiness, and rollback restoration.
- After accepted merge, run the reviewed installer exactly once from its exact merge SHA and inspect the complete hotfix receipt before any maintenance retry.
- Only after installer PASS, post exactly one new owner `/workspace-ci-maintain diagnose workspace-control cpu` command and prove a durable COMPLETED observation-only receipt; do not reuse failed comment 6437389584.
- Only after the diagnostic receipt is accepted may workspace-control activation be independently gated as the reviewed owner-commanded same-repository CPU pilot with maxRunners=1 and manifest concurrency=1.
- Validate live P1 filesystem isolation, CPU/RAM/runtime envelope, GPU0, exact candidate provenance, deterministic receipts, maintenance authorization/replay behavior, and clean teardown/rollback.
- Leave P2 automatic pull_request/push admission, P3 organization migration, GitHub App credential migration, resource-aware concurrency widening, and unrelated transport cleanup unauthorized.

## Blockers / gates

- The accepted reconciler correction is merged but not yet installed on Lambda.
- Activation/reconciliation remains blocked until the reviewed live hotfix install from merge e4c81ac5fba8c4d9df8450b003147f90d771158b completes and its receipt is reviewed.
- Do not activate workspace-control or mutate project controllers before that receipt gate passes.

## Fresh-chat initialization

@GitHub

https://github.com/adamtrott78/workspace-control

Continue the durable workspace-control task defined by:
Task capsule: tasks/active/workspace-github-actions-selfhosted-control-plane-v1.json

Start from the normal workspace-control root route.
Treat the task capsule, exact durable Git/runtime state, and referenced owning context/evidence as the handoff.
Do not rely on previous conversation state.
Follow the capsule's next_safe_action.
