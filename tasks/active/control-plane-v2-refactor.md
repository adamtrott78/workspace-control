## Task

- ID: `control-plane-v2-refactor`
- Title: Workspace Control Plane v2
- Status: `IN_PROGRESS`

## Goal

Design, implement, and validate a workspace-control v2 architecture that generalizes the proven tutor, Codex, DIRECT_TOOL, human-gate, and PADataset/MILCOM workflow evidence into an executor-neutral, resumable multi-stage control plane without moving project-domain authority out of project repositories.

## Current target

- Repository: `workspace-control`
- Branch: `control-plane-v2-refactor`
- Base: `cb8368cd50de2d364c2aade8843276aab0b02420`
- Current checkpoint: `5000900823150676d356c54642efdefc560878ca`
- Pushed: `true`

### Allowed mutation scope

- `architecture/control-plane-v2.md`
- `architecture/control-plane-v2-implementation.md`
- `schemas/task_capsule.v1.schema.json`
- `schemas/task_capsule.v2.schema.json`
- `schemas/workflow_descriptor.v1.schema.json`
- `tests/test_workspace_control.py`
- `tests/fixtures/**`

## Next safe action

On control-plane-v2-refactor@5000900823150676d356c54642efdefc560878ca, verify the branch/ref still points to that exact parent, then create only the Phase 2 schema/test scaffolding paths in one coherent commit if possible. Do not modify scripts/workspace_control.py or shared contracts yet. Validate exact changed paths and v1 schema equivalence afterward.

## Remaining work

- Implement Phase 2 compatibility scaffolding in one coherent commit if the low-level Git surface supports exact-parent tree construction safely.
- Prove the v1 schema copy is byte-equivalent to the current schema before any executable behavior changes.
- Add a v2 capsule schema skeleton, workflow descriptor schema skeleton, standard-library test harness, and fixtures without modifying scripts/workspace_control.py.
- Review and validate the exact Phase 2 diff.
- Only after Phase 2 passes, open the next bounded scope for shared-contract integration.

## Validation state

- **Preserved evidence branches verified before v2 initialization:** `PASS`
  - GitHub branch endpoints matched the expected main, shared bridge, Codex target, and Phase-4 coordination SHAs.
- **New v2 branches created from exact baseline:** `PASS`
  - Both control-plane-v2-refactor and control-plane-v2-coordination were created from cb8368cd50de2d364c2aade8843276aab0b02420.
- **V2 architecture specification reviewed:** `PASS`
  - architecture/control-plane-v2.md reviewed and refined through control-plane-v2-refactor@07075963f2d56f1bf76d562de3f6a6dc0d16c43d
  - Review resolved authority-owner vs execution-owner ambiguity, workflow version binding, checkpoint bundles, HANDOFF_SAFE vs EXECUTION_READY, artifact lifecycle overlap, generated handoff authority, secret handling, consequence classes, and coordination-state placement.
- **Integrated v2 implementation validated:** `NOT_RUN`
- **Cross-executor regression suite completed:** `NOT_RUN`
- **Initial v2 architecture draft created within authorized target scope:** `PASS`
  - Target branch changed only by architecture/control-plane-v2.md at 93c7cbbd82ed9d46e43c2ad38a57ba81165e8f3e.
- **Architecture branch remained within authorized review scope:** `PASS`
  - Compare cb8368cd50de2d364c2aade8843276aab0b02420...07075963f2d56f1bf76d562de3f6a6dc0d16c43d shows only architecture/control-plane-v2.md changed.
- **Implementation plan created within authorized planning scope:** `PASS`
  - Only architecture/control-plane-v2.md and architecture/control-plane-v2-implementation.md are authorized target paths at this stage.
- **V2 implementation plan reviewed:** `PASS`
  - architecture/control-plane-v2-implementation.md reviewed through control-plane-v2-refactor@5000900823150676d356c54642efdefc560878ca
  - Review preserved exact shared-contract pins, optional workflow descriptors, deferred project adoption, and derived handoff synchronization.

## Blockers / known limitations

- The v1 HANDOFF_SAFE checker is local-worktree-centric. This capsule is durable remote coordination state, but formal v1 HANDOFF_SAFE validation requires an isolated local worktree at the recorded checkout path. Do not confuse this known v1 checker limitation with loss of the remote task state.

## Fresh-chat initialization

```text
@GitHub

Continue the durable workspace-control task defined by:

Repository:
adamtrott78/workspace-control

Coordination branch:
control-plane-v2-coordination

Task capsule:
tasks/active/control-plane-v2-refactor.json

Treat the task capsule, the normal workspace-control root route, exact Git state, and the durable evidence referenced by the capsule as the handoff.

Do not rely on previous conversation state.

Follow the capsule's next_safe_action.

Current target branch:
control-plane-v2-refactor

Current target checkpoint:
5000900823150676d356c54642efdefc560878ca

Do not broaden mutation scope beyond the capsule.
```
