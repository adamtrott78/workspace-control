# Workspace Control Task Handoff

Derived human-readable view.

Authoritative capsule: tasks/active/workspace-semantic-control-hardening-v1.json

If this view disagrees with the JSON capsule or verified Git/runtime evidence, trust the capsule plus verified evidence.

## Task

- ID: workspace-semantic-control-hardening-v1
- Title: Semantic Control Hardening v1
- Status: COMPLETE
- Capsule schema: v2

## Goal

Harden the generic semantic-control substrate independently of the Local EXTRACT scientific task by proving historical decision replay, temporal/supersession/contradiction behavior, stale-state and version-skew failure isolation, bounded ontology-slice retrieval, generalized request-only EvidenceRequirement semantics, end-to-end DecisionEvaluation audit chains, deterministic scale behavior, and a consumer-side opaque EXTRACT integration socket. This task must improve the semantic-control infrastructure without defining, steering, implementing, or mutating EXTRACT.

## Repositories

### workspace-control

- Intent: mutate
- Remote branch: main
- Remote checkpoint: 086ebf8b03dc136d733b3b9541551ea0dd99c316
- Remote verified: true

### research-engine

- Intent: mutate

- Remote verified: true

## Next safe action

Task COMPLETE. Preserve HARDENING_PASS at research-engine@33b44e201b8464dd033b748afe34a5f7e26646cd. Future integration may consume this checkpoint only after its independent accepted-EXTRACT-output gate is satisfied; any new hardening scope requires a separate task.

## Remaining work

- None.

## Blockers / gates

- None.

## Fresh-chat initialization

Continue the durable workspace-control task defined by:
Task capsule: tasks/active/workspace-semantic-control-hardening-v1.json

Start from the normal workspace-control root route.
Treat the task capsule, exact durable Git/runtime state, and referenced owning context/evidence as the handoff.
Do not rely on previous conversation state.
Follow the capsule's next_safe_action.
